Problem Statement:
Misdiagnosis of the many diseases impacting agricultural crops can lead to misuse of chemicals leading to the emergence 
of resistant pathogen strains, increased input costs, and more outbreaks with significant economic loss and environmental impacts. 
Current disease diagnosis based on human scouting is time-consuming and expensive, and although computer-vision based models have 
the promise to increase efficiency, the great variance in symptoms due to age of infected tissues, genetic variations, and light 
conditions within trees decreases the accuracy of detection.
